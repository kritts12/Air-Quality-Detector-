# Air-Quality-Detector-

This project is an Air Quality Detector application built using Python's Tkinter library and the PIL library for image handling. It fetches real-time air quality data for a specific zip code from the AirNow API. The application retrieves and displays information such as the city name, air quality index (AQI), and the category of air quality (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy). The GUI displays this information in a simple window with a green background. If the data cannot be retrieved, an error message is displayed instead.
